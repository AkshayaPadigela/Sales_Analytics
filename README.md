## Steps Overview:
1.**Data Acquisition and Preparation**:
Gather the raw sales data from the Superstore database or other relevant sources.
Clean and transform the data using Power Query Editor. Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies.
Create calculated columns or measures as needed (e.g., profit margin, order quantity, etc.).

2.**Data Modeling**:
Design a star schema or snowflake schema for efficient data modeling.
Create relationships between tables (e.g., Sales, Products, Customers, etc.).
Define hierarchies (e.g., date hierarchy) for better drill-down capabilities.

3.**Dashboard Design**:
Open Power BI Desktop and create a new report.
Add visuals (charts, tables, maps) to the canvas.
Arrange visuals logically to create an intuitive layout.
Use color schemes and fonts consistently for a professional look.

4.**Key Visualizations**:

*Sales Overview*:
Display total sales, profit, and other KPIs.

*Sales by Ship Mode*:
Create a pie chart showing the distribution of shipping modes (e.g., standard, express, etc.).

*Monthly Sales*:
Use a line chart to visualize sales trends over time (months).

*Sales by Segment*:
Another pie chart showing sales contribution by customer segments (e.g., consumer, corporate, etc.).

*Sales by Category*:
Bar chart displaying sales for different product categories (furniture, technology, office supplies).

*Profit Analysis*:
Line chart showing monthly profit trends.

*Order Quantity*:
Simple numeric display of total orders processed.

*Average Daily Delivery Count*:
Numeric display of average daily deliveries.

5.**Filters and Slicers**:
Add filters/slicers for interactive exploration.
Users can filter by date range, region, or other relevant dimensions.
